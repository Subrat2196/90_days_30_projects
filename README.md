Hey everyone!
Iâ€™m kicking off a challenge Iâ€™ve been thinking about for a while -> 30 end-to-end ML, NLP & Generative AI projects in 90 days. 
Not just model training, but everything:
 ğŸ‘‰ Data collection & cleaning
 ğŸ‘‰ ML/NLP end to end Pipelines
 ğŸ‘‰ Generative AI apps with OpenAI API,Langchain, FastAPI, Streamlit
 ğŸ‘‰ Deployment & debugging in Cloud Platforms (AWS, Google Cloud)
 ğŸ‘‰ And all the blockers that come with it ğŸ˜…
Iâ€™ll be sharing:
 ğŸ”¹ Code + architecture
 ğŸ”¹ Things that didnâ€™t work
 ğŸ”¹ Important questions that come up
 ğŸ”¹ Interview-level insights I learn along the way
This is me building in public to stay consistent, go deep, and connect with folks in the AI/ML space.
